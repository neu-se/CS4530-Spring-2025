As you ramp up your work on the final project, please don't forget that {going forward} process-related submissions (i.e., peer evauluations, TA meetings, sprint reports, etc.) are due almost every week.

We have also published requirements for [final project deliverables]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link Assignments/project-deliverable.md %}) on the course website. This includes [grading rubrics]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link Assignments/project-grading.md %}) and other requirements related to the submission of the final project (i.e., code/testing, report, posters and demos). Canvas assignments for these are also published now.

In addition, each instructor has provided a list of [expectations for the final demos / presentations] with the grading rubric. Please be sure to review these quickly.
