As you ramp up your work on the final project, please don't forget that {going forward} process-related submissions (i.e., peer evauluations, TA meetings, sprint reports, etc.) are due almost every week.

We have also published requirements for [final project deliverables](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Spring-2025/assignments/project-deliverable) on the course website. This includes [grading rubrics](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Spring-2025/assignments/project-grading) and other requirements related to the submission of the final project (i.e., code/testing, report, posters and demos). Canvas assignments for these are also published now.

In addition, each instructor has provided a list of [expectations for the final demos / presentations](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Spring-2025/assignments/project-grading#posters-and-demo-10). Please be sure to review these quickly.
