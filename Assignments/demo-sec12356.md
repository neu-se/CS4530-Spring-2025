# Specifications for Live Demos / PresentationsÂ (Sections 1, 2, 3, 5, & 6 - Prof. Bhutta)
Each group will present a live demo to show the feature that they have added for the final project. The schedule of these demos will be discussed/finalized during the lecture. You will have 9 minutes maximum (8 minutes to setup and present. 1 minute for questions and everything else). You will lose points if your demo goes over 8 minutes. Please rehearse it and time yourself (best to keep it to 5 minutes or less). 
Please note:
- The demo MUST be from hosted website, NOT from localhost. 
- Attendance is REQUIRED for these demos. Please email the instructor if you have extenuating circumstances.
- Each group will be required to submit copy of presentation (along with poster) on Canvas.
- Each group will also be required to grade demos of other groups.

Your presentation should include the following:
- {Required} Description of feature(s) implemented [no more than 1 slide]
- {Required} Checklist of all user stories and COS (what was proposed vs what was implemented). Feel free to use percentages to show progress. [a list or table from your project plan would be acceptable]
- {Required} Discuss any deviations from the proposed plan (if any)? [no more than 1 slide]
- {Required} If you did not complete any essential or desirable features, discuss why. [no more than 1 slide]
- {Optional} Discuss any challenges you faced and how did you resolve them. [no more than 1 slide]
- {Required} Short summary of overall contributions made by each member [no more than 1 slide with 1-2 sentences per member];
- {Required} What percentage of overall contribution was made by each member and what are the estimated number of hours spent on the {overall} development work during the project by each member excluding research tasks or time spent on project plans [no more than 1 slide];

During your presentation, you might want to consider the following order: quick introduction of project idea (or features or user stories) followed by live demo, then present the remaining slides in the order they are listed above or in any order you find appropriate.

You might want to include your email address and other related info (i.e., github repo link, pictures, hosted site link, etc). You will also **submit** a copy of your presentation (pptx/pdf file, not link) on Canvas under "Project: Poster/Demo" assignment.

# Grading Rubric:
Your final Poster and Demos are worth 4% of the overall course. 

Poster will be worth 1% and will be graded based on whether you submitted it on time or not. 

Demos will be worth 3% and will be graded using the following criteria: Each group will evaluate each others' demos and will assign scores (Instructor and TAs will do the same). Your final demo score will be calculated by combining all of these scores (equally weighted). However, you **will NOT** receive points for the demo if your group fails to submit copy of the presentation on Canvas, your scores to instructor or if you are not present for all presentations/demos during class.
